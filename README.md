## The NATS Command Line Interface

A command line utility to interact with and manage NATS.

This utility replaces various past tools that were named in the form `nats-sub` and `nats-pub`, adds several new capabilities
and support full JetStream management.

### Features

* JetStream management
* JetStream data and configuration backup
* Message publish and subscribe
* Service requests and creation
* Benchmarking and Latency testing
* Super Cluster observation
* Configuration context maintenance
* NATS eco system schema registry

### Installation

Releases are [published to GitHub](https://github.com/nats-io/natscli/releases/) where zip, rpm and debs for various
operating systems can be found.

For OS X `brew` can be used to install the latest version:

```nohighlight
brew tap nats-io/nats-tools
brew install nats-io/nats-tools/nats
```

For Arch users there is an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/natscli/) that you can install with:

```
yay natscli
```

Nightly builds are included in the `synadia/nats-server:nightly` Docker images.

### Configuration Contexts

The `nats` CLI supports multiple named configurations, for the rest of the document we'll interact via `demo.nats.io`.
To enable this we'll create a `demo` configuration and set it as default.

First we add a configuration to capture the default `localhost` configuration.
```
nats context add local --description "Localhost"
```
Output
```
NATS Configuration Context "localhost"

  Description: Localhost
  Server URLs: nats://127.0.0.1:4222
```

Next we add a context for `demo.nats.io:4222` and we select it as default.

```
nats context add nats --server demo.nats.io:4222 --description "NATS Demo" --select
```
Output
```
NATS Configuration Context "nats"

  Description: NATS Demo
  Server URLs: demo.nats.io:4222
```

These are the contexts, the `*` indicates the default
```
nats context ls
```
Output
```
Known contexts:

   localhost           Localhost
   nats*               NATS Demo
```

The context is selected as default, use `nats context --help` to see how to add, remove and edit contexts.

### JetStream management

For full information on managing JetStream please refer to the [JetStream Documentation](https://docs.nats.io/jetstream)

As of [nats-server v2.2.0](https://docs.nats.io/release-notes/whats_new/whats_new_22) JetStream is GA.

### Publish and Subscribe

The `nats` CLI can publish messages and subscribe to subjects.

#### Basic Behaviours

We will subscribe to the `cli.demo` subject:

```
nats sub cli.demo 
```
Output
```
12:30:25 Subscribing on cli.demo
``` 

We can now publish messages to the `cli.demo` subject.

First we publish a single message:

```
nats pub cli.demo "hello world" 
```
Output
```
12:31:20 Published 11 bytes to "cli.demo"
```

Next we publish 5 messages with a counter and timestamp in the format `message 5 @ 2020-12-03T12:33:18+01:00`:

```
nats pub cli.demo "message {{.Count}} @ {{.TimeStamp}}" --count=10 
```
Output
```
12:33:17 Published 33 bytes to "cli.demo"
12:33:17 Published 33 bytes to "cli.demo"
12:33:17 Published 33 bytes to "cli.demo"
12:33:18 Published 33 bytes to "cli.demo"
12:33:18 Published 33 bytes to "cli.demo"
```

We can also publish messages read from STDIN:

```
echo hello|nats pub cli.demo 
```
Output
```
12:34:15 Reading payload from STDIN
12:34:15 Published 6 bytes to "cli.demo"
```

Finally, NATS supports HTTP style headers and the CLI behaves like `curl`:

```
nats pub cli.demo 'hello headers' -H Header1:One -H Header2:Two 
```
Output
```
12:38:44 Published 13 bytes to "cli.demo"
```

The receiver will show:

```
nats sub cli.demo  
```
Output
```
[#47] Received on "cli.demo"
Header1: One
Header2: Two

hello headers
```

#### JetStream

When receiving messages from a JetStream Push Consumer messages can be acknowledged when received by passing `--ack`, the
message metadata is also produced:

```
nats sub js.out.testing --ack 
```
Output
```
12:55:23 Subscribing on js.out.testing with acknowledgement of JetStream messages
[#1] Received JetStream message: consumer: TESTING > TAIL / subject: js.in.testing / delivered: 1 / consumer seq: 568 / stream seq: 2638 / ack: true
test JS message
``` 

#### Queue Groups

When subscribers join a Queue Group the messages are randomly load shared within the group. Perform the following
subscribe in 2 or more shells and then publish messages using some of the methods shown above, these messages will
only be received by one of the subscribers at a time.

```
nats sub cli.demo --queue=Q1
```

### Service Requests and Creation

NATS supports a RPC mechanism where a service received Requests and replies with data in response.

```
nats reply 'cli.weather.>' "Weather Service" 
```
Output
```
12:43:28 Listening on "cli.weather.>" in group "NATS-RPLY-22"
```

In another shell we can send a request to this service:

```
nats request cli.weather.london 
```
Output
```
12:46:34 Sending request on "cli.weather.london"
12:46:35 Received on "_INBOX.BJoZpwsshQM5cKUj8KAkT6.HF9jslpP" rtt 404.76854ms
Weather Service
```

This shows that the service round trip was 404ms, and we can see the response `Weather Service`.

To make this a bit more interesting we can interact with the `wttr.in` web service:

```
nats reply 'cli.weather.>' --command "curl -s wttr.in/{{2}}?format=3" 
```
Output
```
12:47:03 Listening on "cli.weather.>" in group "NATS-RPLY-22"
```

We can perform the same request again:

```
nats request "cli.weather.{london,newyork}" '' --raw 
```
Output
```
london: üå¶ +7¬∞C
newyork: ‚òÄÔ∏è +2¬∞C
```

Now the `nats` CLI parses the subject, extracts the `{london,newyork}` from the subjects and calls `curl`, replacing
`{{2}}` with the body of the 2nd subject token - `{london,newyork}`.

## Benchmarking and Latency Testing

Benchmarking and latency testing is key requirement for evaluating the production preparedness of your NATS network.

### Benchmarking

Here we'll run these benchmarks against a local server instead of `demo.nats.io`.

```
nats context select localhost 
```
Output
```
NATS Configuration Context "localhost"

  Description: Localhost
  Server URLs: nats://127.0.0.1:4222
```

We can benchmark core NATS publishing performance, here we publish 10 million messages from 5 concurrent publishers. By
default messages are published as quick as possible without any acknowledgement or confirmations:

```
nats bench test --msgs=10000000 --pub 5 
```
Output
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <13:03:30

Adding `--sub 2` will start two subscribers on the same subject and measure the rate of messages:

```
nats bench test --msgs=10000000 --pub 5 --sub 2 
```
Output

```

JetStream testing can be done by adding the `--js` flag. You can for example measure first the speed of publishing into a stream

```
nats bench js.bench --js --pub 2 --msgs 1000000 --purge 
```
Output
```
01:37:36 Starting benchmark [msgs=1,000,000, msgsize=128 B, pubs=2, subs=0, js=true, stream=benchstream  storage=memory, syncpub=false, pubbatch=100, jstimeout=30s, pull=false, pullbatch=100, request=false, reply=false, noqueue=false, maxackpending=-1, replicas=1, purge=true]

 min 207,572 | avg 207,739 | max 207,907 | stddev 167 msgs
```
And then you can for example measure the speed of receiving (i.e. replay) the messages from the stream using ordered push consumers
```
nats bench js.bench --js --sub 4 --msgs 1000000 
```
Output
```
01:40:05 Starting benchmark [msgs=1,000,000, msgsize=128 B, pubs=0, subs=4, js=true, stream=benchstream  storage=memory, syncpub=false, pubbatch=100, jstimeout=30s, pull=false, pullbatch=100, request=false, reply=false, noqueue=false, maxackpending=-1, replicas=1, purge=false]

```

Similarily you can benchmark synchronous request-reply type of interactions using the `--request` and `--reply` flags. For example you can first start one (or more) replier(s)

```
nats bench test --sub 2 --reply
```

And then run a benchmark with one (or more) synchronous requester(s)

```
nats bench test --pub 10 --request  
```
Output
```

```

There are numerous other flags that can be set to configure size of messages, using push or pull JetStream consumers and much more, see `nats bench --help`.

### Latency

Latency is the rate at which messages can cross your network, with the `nats` CLI you can connect a publisher and subscriber
to your NATS network and measure the latency between the publisher and subscriber.

```
nats latency --server-b localhost:4222 --rate 500000  
```
Output
```
==============================
Pub Server RTT : 64¬µs
Sub Server RTT : 70¬µs

1st Sent Wall Time : 3.091ms
Last Sent Wall Time: 5.000098s
Last Recv Wall Time: 5.000168s
```

Various flags exist to adjust message size and target rates, see `nats latency --help`

## Super Cluster observation

NATS publish a number of events and have a Request-Reply API that expose a wealth of internal information about the
state of the network.

For most of these features you will need a [System Account](https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/sys_accounts)
enabled, most of these commands are run against that account.

I create a `system` context before running these commands and pass that to the commands.

### Lifecycle Events

```
nats event --context system 
```
Output
```
Listening for Client Connection events on $SYS.ACCOUNT.*.CONNECT
Listening for Client Disconnection events on $SYS.ACCOUNT.*.DISCONNECT
Listening for Authentication Errors events on $SYS.SERVER.*.CLIENT.AUTH.ERR

            Account: one

   Stats:

     Published: 1 messages (0 B)
           RTT: 1.551714ms
```

Here one can see a client connected and disconnected shortly after, several other system events are supported.

If an account is running JetStream the `nats event` tool can also be used to look at JetStream advisories by passing
`--js-metric --js-advisory`

These events are JSON messages and can be viewed raw using `--json` or in Cloud Events format with `--cloudevent`,
finally a short version of the messages can be shown:

```
nats event --short 
```
Output
```
Listening for Client Connection events on $SYS.ACCOUNT.*.CONNECT
Listening for Client Disconnection events on $SYS.ACCOUNT.*.DISCONNECT
Listening for Authentication Errors events on $SYS.SERVER.*.CLIENT.AUTH.ERR

12:21:00 [Disconnection] user: one cid: 20 in account one: Client Closed
12:21:00 [Connection] user: one cid: 21 in account one
```

### Super Cluster Discovery and Observation

When a cluster or super cluster of NATS servers is configured with a system account a wealth of information is available
via internal APIs, the `nats` tool can interact with these and observe your servers.

A quick view of the available servers and your network RTT to each can be seen with `nats server ping`:

```
nats server ping 
```
Output
```
nc1-c1                                                       rtt=2.30864ms
nc3-c1                                                       rtt=2.396573ms
nc2-c1                                                       rtt=2.484994ms
nc3-c2                                                       rtt=2.549958ms
...

---- ping statistics ----
9 replies max: 3.00 min: 1.00 avg: 2.78
```

A general server overview can be seen with `nats server list`:

```
nats server list 
```
Output
```

Additional to this various reports can be generated using `nats server report`, this allows one to list all connections and
subscriptions across the entire cluster with filtering to limit the results by account etc.

Additional raw information in JSON format can be retrieved using the `nats server request` commands.

### Schema Registry

We are adopting JSON Schema to describe the core data formats of events and advisories - as shown by `nats event`. Additionally
all the API interactions with the JetStream API is documented using the same format.

These schemas can be used using tools like [QuickType](https://app.quicktype.io/) to generate stubs for various programming
languages.

The `nats` CLI allows you to view these schemas and validate documents using these schemas.

```
nats schema ls 
```
Output
```
Matched Schemas:

  io.nats.jetstream.advisory.v1.api_audit
  io.nats.jetstream.advisory.v1.consumer_action
  io.nats.jetstream.advisory.v1.max_deliver
...
```

The schemas can be limited using a regular expression, try `nats schema ls request` to see all API requests.

Schemas can be viewed in their raw JSON or YAML formats using `nats schema info io.nats.jetstream.advisory.v1.consumer_action`,
these schemas include descriptions about each field and more.

Finally, if you are interacting with the API using JSON request messages constructed using languages that is not supported
by our own management libraries you can use this tool to validate your messages:

```
nats schema validate io.nats.jetstream.api.v1.stream_create_request request.json 
```
Output
```
Validation errors in request.json:

  retention: retention must be one of the following: "limits", "interest", "workqueue"
  (root): Must validate all the schemas (allOf)

``` 

Here I validate `request.json` against the Schema that describes the API to create Streams, the validation indicates
that I have an incorrect value in the `retention` field.
